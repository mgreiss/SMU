PyMaceuticals Analysis

This project analyzes the effectiveness of several drug regimens on tumor growth in mice. 
The dataset used contains information about mouse treatments, tumor volumes, and weight over time.
The analysis includes several key tasks such as generating plots to visualize the effects of different treatments, calculating averages, and filtering data.

Sources of Guidance
Professor's Office Hours:
Much of the code was developed with guidance from the instructor during in-class office hours. The professor answered questions regarding the homework and helped address various coding errors related to data processing, plotting, and grouping.

XpertLearning:
XpertLearning was a valuable resource for resolving additional issues encountered while generating graphs and addressing specific errors related to plot generation.
XpertLearning tutorials and examples were particularly helpful in identifying mistakes with axis limits and column aggregation.
